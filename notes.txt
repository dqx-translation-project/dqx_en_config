- copy all hex in exe at bottom using a hex editor that supports utf8 encoding (wxMEdit)
  - hex starts at '54 45 58 54 10 00 00 00 F0 1E 01 00 00 00 00 00' for settings
  - hex starts at '54 45 58 54 10 00 00 00 C0 02 00 00 00 00 00 00' for buttons
  - copy until FOOT found
- paste into text editor and replace:
  - 0a with 7c
  - 00 with 0a
  - this ends up being the "base" file
- this data has already been converted to json and translated in settings.json
- run transform.ahk, which will spit out a hexFinal_settings.txt file
- copy all this text and paste exactly what was copied out of the hex editor back into the hex editor in the same exact place
- assuming this was done correctly, save the file and the exe is translated

thoughts:
- maybe try scripting this out with xxd
